        <p style >Our solar system consists of our star, the Sun, and everything bound to it by gravity – the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune; dwarf planets such as Pluto; dozens of moons; and millions of asteroids, comets, and meteoroids. Beyond our own solar system, we have discovered thousands of planetary systems orbiting other stars in the <i>Milky Way</i>.The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. The vast majority (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in the planet Jupiter. The planetary system around the Sun contains eight planets. The four inner system planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—are terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal. The four giant planets of the outer system are substantially larger and more massive than the terrestrials. The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the next two, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of volatile substances with relatively high melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, such as water, ammonia, and methane. All eight planets have nearly circular orbits that lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic. </p>
     <h3>7 Need-to-Know Things About the Solar System</h3>
     <ol>
        <li>Our solar system is made up of a star, eight planets, and countless smaller bodies such as dwarf planets, asteroids, and comets.</li>
        <li>Our solar system orbits the center of the <i>Milky Way</i> galaxy at about <b>515,000</b> mph. We’re in one of the galaxy’s four spiral arms.</li>
        <li>It takes our solar system about 230 million years to complete one orbit around the galactic center.</li>
        <li>There are three general kinds of galaxies: elliptical, spiral, and irregular. The <i>Milky Way</i> is a spiral galaxy.</li>
        <li>Our solar system is a region of space. It has no atmosphere. But it contains many worlds – including Earth – with many kinds of atmospheres.</li>
        <li>Our solar system is the only one known to support life. So far, we only know of life on Earth, but we’re looking for more everywhere we can.</li>
        <li>The four giant planets – and at least one asteroid – have rings. None are as spectacular as Saturn’s gorgeous rings.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>Earth is not flat, but it's not perfectly round either :) </li>
                <li>The days are getting longer</li>
                <li>There weren't always several continents</li>
                <li>Earth's icy times</li>
                <li>The driest place on Earth is Atacama Desert</li>
                <li>Earth's gravity isn't uniform</li>
                <li>In the past, sea levels were very different</li>

        Let's take a look on each of them.
        <p>Earth has never been perfectly round. Earth's diameter from North to South Pole is <b>7,900 miles</b>, while through the equator it is <b>926 miles</b>. The difference — <b>26.58 miles</b> — is about 1/300th the diameter of Earth. This variation is too tiny to be seen in pictures of Earth from space, so the planet appears round to the human eye.</p>
        <main>
         Earth's expected long-term future is tied to that of the Sun. Over the next 1.1 billion years, solar luminosity will increase by 10%, and over the next 3.5 billion years by 40%. Earth's increasing surface temperature will accelerate the inorganic carbon cycle, reducing CO2 concentration to levels lethally low for plants in approximately 100–900 million years. The lack of vegetation will result in the loss of oxygen in the atmosphere, making animal life impossible.
